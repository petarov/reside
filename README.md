# Why?

IDEs like IntelliJ already provide mature and reliable resource bundles [editor UI](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/resource-bundle-editor.html), so this tool does not offer anything new for developers. However, it is not just developers that need 
to edit and maintain locale-specific data. Other members on your team that do not
have access to an IDE may benefit from using this tool.
